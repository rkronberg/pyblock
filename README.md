# block-quad
Python codes for computing error estimates for the averages of correlated timeseries as well as numerical integration using the cumulative composite trapezoidal rule. Uncertainty propagation induced by the integration can be accounted for if error bounds are given for the input data. 

Same thing implemented also in Julia for fun.
